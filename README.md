We are implementing an all-in-one club managerial software which utilizes Discord (primary communication platform for clubs) to automate menial tasks such as attendance, student verification, meeting reminders, and other administrative tasks. This will be packed into a singular Discord bot with a focus on an efficient and aesthetic software experience making it easy to kickstart fresh clubs as well as established clubs so they can focus on what matters most to them.
